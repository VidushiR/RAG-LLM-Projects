  The location of acoustic emission on complicated aircraft frame structures is
a difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes an
intelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises
a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the
location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was
tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of
location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the
dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location
accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by
the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the
intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is
avoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft
frame structures by the acoustic emission method.","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Sun, 1 Apr 2007 13:06:50 GMT'}]",2009-09-29,"[['Kosel', 'T.', ''], ['Grabec', 'I.', '']]",1172,169,"['cs.NE', 'cs.AI']",1,0,2009

  Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of
developing defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various
statistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is
separation and characterization of signal components when the signals from
various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source
separation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve
these problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability
of ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission
sources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for
non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission
analysis.","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Sun, 1 Apr 2007 18:53:13 GMT'}]",2007-05-23,"[['Kosel', 'T.', ''], ['Grabec', 'I.', '']]",950,136,"['cs.NE', 'cs.AI']",1,0,2007

  Consensus",Submitted to IEEE Transactions,,10.1109/TSP.2008.920143,,cs.IT cs.LG math.IT,,"In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject
to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since
sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,
or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in
determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.
These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.
The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the
probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to
maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link
communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall
communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number
of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)
establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and
almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;
and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both
mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph
describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we
formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a
communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to
which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive
numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence
speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of
a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Fri, 6 Apr 2007 21:58:52 GMT'}]",2009-11-13,"[['Kar', 'Soummya', ''], ['Moura', 'Jose M. F.', '']]",1748,266,"['cs.IT', 'cs.LG', 'math.IT']",1,1,2009

partial monitoring. Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights
can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in
each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the
loss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing
edges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed
bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the
weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an
algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of
the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by
a quantity that is proportional to 1/\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on
the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear
complexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension
to the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision
maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen
path at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the
decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the
problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit
setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns
only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual
edges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along

Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning

contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad
class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application
domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce
immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm
for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO
problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two
contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution
we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and
bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures
ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated
values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations
are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location
information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample
locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an
additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Tue, 10 Apr 2007 17:01:07 GMT'}]",2011-11-09,"[['Wolpert', 'David H.', ''], ['Rajnarayan', 'Dev G.', '']]",1340,197,['cs.LG'],1,0,2011

were primary, secondary and tertiary structures, accessibility and packing.
HMMER-STRUCT then prioritizes the results by voting. Results: We used the SCOP
database to perform our experiments. Throughout, we apply leave-one-family-out

we compared the voting model against individual pHMMs. We compare method
performance through ROC curves and through Precision/Recall curves, and assess
significance through the paired two tailed t-test. Our results show significant

incorrectly) classified with respect to the labels is maximized (resp.
minimized). The two complementary problems are called MaxAgree and MinDisagree,

labeled, and general graphs, where some edge might not have been labeled.
Natural edge-weighted versions of both problems have been studied as well. Let
S-MaxAgree denote the weighted problem where all weights are taken from set S,

$\lambda = O(\log{|V|})$ with high probability, then for any choice of S',
S'-MaxAgree can be approximated in polynomial time within a factor of $(\lambda

probability. A similar statement also holds for $S-MinDisagree. This result
implies it is hard (assuming $NP \neq RP$) to approximate unweighted MaxAgree

network properties. Rather, what one can see are the global patterns of its use
and, thus, a global view of the power and organization of the underlying

build a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed
to adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of
structure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria
assuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic
relations. At the end, what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that
enables us i) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii) to build
a network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard

  In this paper we investigate the problem of using max-product to find the
maximum weight matching in an arbitrary graph with edge weights. This is done
by first constructing a probability distribution whose mode corresponds to the
optimal matching, and then running max-product. Weighted matching can also be
posed as an integer program, for which there is an LP relaxation. This
relaxation is not always tight. In this paper we show that \begin{enumerate}

that too to the correct answer. \item If the LP relaxation is loose, then
max-product does not converge. \end{enumerate} This provides an exact,

connection to LP relaxation, which is a well-studied optimization technique.

regardless of how it was initiated. The prospect of using tools, methods and
theory from the field of epidemiology to do this seems natural and appealing.
We will address the feasibility of such a prospect, first by considering some
basic measures used in epidemiology, then by pointing out the differences
between real world epidemics and virtual plagues. We also suggest directions
for MMOG developer control through epidemiological modeling. Our aim is
understanding the properties of virtual plagues, rather than trying to
eliminate them or mitigate their effects, as would be in the case of real
infectious disease.","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Thu, 31 May 2007 12:15:05 GMT'}]",2007-06-01,"[['Boman', 'Magnus', ''], ['Johansson', 'Stefan J.', '']]",1068,165,"['cs.CY', 'cs.AI', 'cs.MA']",1,0,2007

by irreducible polynomials is pairwise independent, our implementations either
run in time O(n) or use an exponential amount of memory. As a more scalable
alternative, we make hashing by cyclic polynomials pairwise independent by
ignoring n-1 bits. Experimentally, we show that hashing by cyclic polynomials

data modeling medium where real and conceptual entities are related in
semantically meaningful ways. However, new models have emerged that explicitly
encode procedural information within the semantic network substrate. With these
new technologies, the Semantic Web has evolved from a data modeling medium to a
computational medium. This article provides a classification of existing

virtual sensor models which used data from real sensors (Lam Station sensors,
Optical Emission Spectroscopy, and RF Monitoring) to predict recipe setpoints
and wafer state characteristics. Fault detection and classification were
performed by comparing predicted recipe and wafer state values with expected
values. Models utilized include linear PLS, Polynomial PLS, and Neural Network
PLS. Prediction of recipe setpoints based upon sensor data provides a
capability for cross-checking that the machine is maintaining the desired
setpoints. Wafer state characteristics such as Line Width Reduction and
Remaining Oxide were estimated on-line using these same process sensors (Lam,
OES, RFM). Wafer-to-wafer measurement of these characteristics in a production
setting (where typically this information may be only sparsely available, if at
all, after batch processing runs with numerous wafers have been completed)
would provide important information to the operator that the process is or is
not producing wafers within acceptable bounds of product quality. Production
yield is increased, and correspondingly per unit cost is reduced, by providing
the operator with the opportunity to adjust the process or machine before
etching more wafers.","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Mon, 4 Jun 2007 15:55:27 GMT'}]",2007-06-05,"[['Sofge', 'D. A.', '']]",1541,221,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CV']",1,0,2007
